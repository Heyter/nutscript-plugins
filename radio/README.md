#radio modified
this is a modified version of the radio plugin found in chessnut's hl2rp schema
besides the jamming checks (something i wont release because i implemented it yuckily and i dont like it), 
the main thing thats different about this is the language fixes, and an additional radio command that is a whisper, but i figured id include it anyway
theres also commented out references to with another plugin, but thats not getting released as that was made for 1.1 and i never fully converted it to ns2
