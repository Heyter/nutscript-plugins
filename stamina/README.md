# stamina modified
this is a modified version of the default stamina plugin, its made to work along side shoottorp and the needs plugin
for shoottorp it changes it to use some armor resist bonuses
and for needs its needed for the high thirst bonus (which is faster stamina recovery)

do not just copy and replace the original version, i rename the stamina stat to quickness (for compatibility with the endurance stat from shoottorp), and the endurance stat to stamina, so youll have an extra stat in there if you do that

the only other change that actually affects general gameplay is that i changed it so the bonus to recovering stamina when crouching now only works when not moving as well
