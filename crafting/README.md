# crafting
a (relatively) simple but extensive crafting plugin
- see config for recipe examples/template (i just left the recipes from my prior schema in there so its kinda a huge mess lmao)
- in entities you can find ents to create workbenches from
- also included is a new base item type called junk, this are quantity based and can be deconstructed into other items (meant to be used for  crafting components)
- integrates with traits but not required (it checks if you have traits, and also supports attribute and flag checks)
- also included is a massitems file, used to mass create junk items (so you wont need an individual file for each of them)
