# tying
a modified tying plugin

there are 4 major things changed/added in this plugin (or related plugins):
1. when restricted, your bones are now modified to show your hands behind your back
2. implements a trait from traits, escape artist, which allows you once per day to attempt to untie yourself using the /struggle command. (which is also used with the tape tie)
3. theres an extra function on the duct tape in the crafting plugin, that uses a new type(/distinction?) of tie (tape tie), this allows everyone to use the struggle command to try and escape it even if they dont have the escape artist trait
4. shoottorp halves the speed of tied people (primarily for the animation mods tbh, at full speed it looked very goofy lmao)

other than these, its basically the same as the tying plugin in the official hl2rp on github
