## director
a modified (lite) version of an older plugin of mine, this automatically spawns default or a specified type of enemy around an area
- the default class is an npc that im not gonna make public so make sure to replace it: `nz_sky_synth`
- the spawnLevels table is basically the only thing that should be modified other than that tho, you create/modify/delete points via commands ingame
