# bountyboard
this is an ***untested*** odd job like system, with randomly generated jobs. this is designed to work along side autoevents (as one of the example events only can spawn with an autoevents event type)
there are 2 jobs that were implemented: a collect a number of an item job (issued whenever), and a bandit bounty job (spawned with the bandit camp type in autoevents).
the first one is self explanatory, it has a limited time before it expires.
when the bandit camp is spawned, theres a random chance for a bandit among the npcs to be given a bounty, when that bandit dies they drop a special item, this item can then be given to the bountyboard to turn it in, it remains for as long as the item hasnt been turned in
these jobs dont need to be accepted, you just need to be the one to turn it in to get the reward, so anyone who knows about it can do them.
